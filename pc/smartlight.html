            <h3>How it was like</h3>
            <p>
              I worked as an UX designer and got a chance to lead a team of 3
              members including Graphic Designer, Industrial Designer & UI
              Designer. Our mission was to create smart bulb from package to its
              shape and the application to control it.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_1.png" alt="My crew" class="article_img" />
            <p class="img_caption">
              Four of us was working closely together on this project.
            </p>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
              The overall view is always my top priority when I start a project,
              not only from a designer’s view but other aspects. Talking to
              stakeholders helps me grabbing the ideas of bussiness goals as
              well as their needs and wants. Plus, having a conversation with
              them regularly is also a good way to build relationship, which is
              very important in the work.
            </p>
            <h3>Expectations & Visions</h3>
            <p>
              Shareholders always got their expectations about the project, even
              there is nothing clear in their mind at the beginning stages
              (which usually happens), I”ll always ask them some questions to
              get their ideas, pain points, what they need, etc. Capturing these
              things is essential. It minimizes risk, saves time and team’s
              effort. And below is what I got after discussing with them:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Modern-looking, minimalist & bright tone.</li>
              <li>Easy to use.</li>
              <li>Cross-platform.</li>
              <li>
                Goal: Largest smart light supplier for business customers (B2B)
              </li>
              <li>
                Target group of user: young and middle-aged customers,
                successful, good financial, living in apartment in developed
                cities. Technology-lovers and willing to pay to improve the
                convenience of life.
              </li>

            </p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
              The biggest challenge that I faced was the shareholders’
              misconception. To them, all about design was just the “look” side,
              and they wanted it to be done as quickly as possible. To cope with
              it, I did show them the 3W:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span>WHAT</span> exactly we were going to do.</li>
              <li><span>WHY</span> we needed to perform it, and:</li>
              <li><span>WHEN</span> should we make it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Another problem we had was that manpower shortage to start the job
              as we aimed. However, this is a part of work, and our job is to
              find solution for it.
            </p>
            <h3>Action</h3>
            <h4>1. Research product</h4>
            <p>
              Lack of knowledge about new domain made us felt a bit confused to
              get started. So I decided to research informations about “Light”
              and transfered it to the whole team, here was the list to begin:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Types of bulbs.</li>
              <li>Uses of each.</li>
              <li>Connection methods.</li>
              <li>Smart bulb’s pros and cons.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Next step, I wanted the team could understand how a smart light
              works, so we purchased some light bulbs, this would benefit:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The industrial designer would know the bulb’s components and how
                it attached to each other.
              </li>
              <li>
                The graphic designer could have some ideas about the package
                look by its features, functions and tons of others elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                The UI designer would sketch about the icon, the mood, the style
                of the product.
              </li>
              <li>
                On my side, I had a picture of how a smart light works. Plus, I
                would know where my competitors were going and if there was
                anything I could improve on.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/Setting Bulb.jpg" alt="" class="article_img" />
            <p class="img_caption">Setting up the light.</p>
            <h4>2. Research users</h4>
            <p>
              After I got some informations from real product testing, I wanted
              to discuss it with relevant teams, which were engineers and
              stakeholders. They gave me a list of features that at that time
              the technology we had was able to do and what features they wanted
              to have. I took them and decided to research on real users, who
              was going to use our product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on our target group of user that we created before, I broke
              it down to 2 categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Experienced in using light automation.</li>
              <li>Never used it but interested about it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I made these 2 groups of user because I wanted to hear their
              thoughts and opinions stood on their knowledge. Then I’ll try to
              reconcile it and to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution.
            </p>
            <p>Here was the result:</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row table_chart">
            <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-7 left_column">
              <h4>Experienced users:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Optimize connection method/reduce steps.</li>
                <li>Unlimited number of lights.</li>
                <li>Other brand accepted.</li>
                <li>Control it from everywhere on Earth.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-7 right_column">
              <h4>Non-Experienced users:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Easy to connect.</li>
                <li>Voice control.</li>
                <li>Other brand accepted.</li>
                <li>More color-mixed.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h4>3. Create user personas</h4>
          <p>
            A deep understanding of target audience is required if we aim for a
            good product. So then I made up User Personas to list down
            everything we knew so far about our users.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/User Personas.png" alt="" class="User Persona" />
          <p class="img_caption">Creating User Personas (Information has been changed due to privacy policy)</p>
          <p>
            Further more, User Personas also benefits to different roles like
            Graphic Designer and UI Designer, they will have more clues to
            visualize things that fit with end users.
          </p>
          <h4>3. User flow</h4>
          <p>
            Next step, I decided to craft User Flow’s first version so
            stakeholders and relevant departments could be able to understand
            how users interact with the app. This step is more cruicial for the
            developers, they would basically know their tasks in future and
            could make a well preperation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keeping closely relationship with developers is also so important. I
            was always kept talking to them, dicussing my ideas about everything
            related to the design: from the flow to the interaction, UI,
            animation, etc. I just wanted to make sure we were totally getting
            our points. Imagine when you’ve done something and the answer you
            took from them is: “Sorry, we don’t have enough resources to perform
            it” or “The time is running out, we have to find the simpler
            solutions”. It’s so frustrated!
          </p>
          <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/User flow.png" alt="" class="article_img" />
          <p class="img_caption">Crafting User Flow</p>
          <h4>4. Wireframe</h4>
          <p>
            Next, I was designing the low-fidelity version of Wireframe. This is
            always my most favorite part. Everything we gathered before now
            could be translated to the design to keep testing on users.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finished it, I made a test on a project-wide scale, where
            every members tried it and gave feedback. Then I did prototyte for
            the mid-fidelity Wireframe and tested it on real users: Here was
            something I got:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users wanted to connect their bulb without sign in.</li>
            <li>They wanted to control the light right at the room screen.</li>
          </ul>
          <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/Wireframe_low.png" alt="" class="article_img" />
          <p class="img_caption">Creating Low-Fidelity Wireframe</p>
          <p>
            At this stage, UI was started to create. The UI guy and I were
            collecting moodboard then trying to create some of the concepts.
            Stakeholders seemed really couln’d wait to see how our app would
            look like, so I gathered the develope teams and we made plans
            together to boost up the UI process.
          </p>
          <p>
            I told them everything about our ideas, how it would be look like
            and in return, we also open to hear their advice, I wanted to know
            if it was possible to perform or not. Everything was to make sure
            that all risks must be kept to a minimum and the only way to do it
            is to maintain communication.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, I kept improving Wireframe and made the high-fidelity
            one. This thing could help calm our stakeholders and our users could
            find it easier to spread their thoughts.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/Wireframe_high.png" alt="" class="article_img" />
          <p class="img_caption">Creating High-Fidelity Wireframe</p>
          <h4>4. Usability testing</h4>
          <p>
            At that point, I came up with this idea: why don’t we make a testing
            environment, where users could experience the product in the place
            looks like their home. After this idea was passed, I listed groups
            of testing audiences and started designing the place. It took 2
            weeks to complete from sketching, designing, procuring materials,
            constructing and finishing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to build a place that resembled an actual house as much as
            possible, this made it more comfortable for users to use and give
            their opinions.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_3.jpeg" alt="" class="article_img" />
          <p class="img_caption">Designing testing environment.</p>
          <p class="fadeInUp">
            To made sure other jobs were still running smoothly, I only gathered
            enough members to do some of the main features that we were going to
            build. Beside, I also created scenarios for users to complete the
            task then we would see where they found unsatisfy.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_5.jpeg" alt="" class="article_img" />
          <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_7.jpeg" alt="" class="article_img" />
          <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_8.jpeg" alt="" class="article_img" />
          <p class="img_caption">Testing on real user.</p>
          <p>
            This test gave us invaluable feedbacks from real users. They were
            tested on an interoperable product, which gave the best indication
            of what they are satisfied/dissatisfied with. And for an UX
            designer, nothing is more valuable than this genuine responses, here
            was what I found:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>They wanted to be able to control all light at one time.</li>
            <li>They wished there were more scenarios to choose.</li>
            <li>
              They wanted their light’s setting could be saved and restored.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Growth</h3>
          <p>
            Working in an early-stage startup was an amazing path that taught me
            alot. I do always look back to see if I there’s anything needed to
            be changed, and here are some key takeaways from this project:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can’t satisfy all users.</li>
            <li>There’s no standard procedure. Be flexible.</li>
            <li>
              Make sure that your stakeholders (and other relevant teams) are
