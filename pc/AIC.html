            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>
                Covid-19 started appearing in where I live at the end of 2019, cases was soaring in a short amount of time and we all wanted to prevent it. And I was so lucky when had a chance using my design skills in order to help my country coping with the pandemic.

            <p class="img_caption">
                We was facing one of a biggest desease in history (Image: Unsplash)
            </p>
            <p>
                Medical authorities along with medical facilities wanted to do digital conversion of their device management system so they could quickly and easily manage their devices. From there, the supply and transportation of equipment to hospitals will be more convenient, helped improving the ability of timely treatment for patients.
            </p>
            <h3>Expectations</h3>
            <p>
                Discussing with stakeholders at the beginning time is always a good way to research about the project, knowing them well will give us some essential key points that we can use to develope work.

                In this case, shareholders told that they used to manage their medical devices in tradition ways and it made them feel thwarted. It involves a lot of risk when running a task and I'll list a few that stand out below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Time consuming.</li>
                <li>Laborious.</li>
                <li>Not instantaneous.</li>
                <li> Lost devices.</li>
            </ul>
              <p>And those were also our main pain points that we had to find solution for it.</p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                The most challenge thing we had to face were time. Lived in the midst of an epidemic crisis with many difficulties were coming, there weren’t room for mistakes. Found the best way for each problems and made it ready as soon as possible, that's something we had to keep in mind all that time. 
            </p>

            <h3>Action</h3>
            <h4>1. Connection</h4>
            <p>
                As many projects I have made before, thing I wanted to do first was building the connection. You just can’t go far without understading your team mate so I was deciding to talk and spread out some of my ideas with my co-workers, especially the Business Analysist (BA) team and Developer (Dev) team. 
            </p>
            <h4>2. Research</h4>
            <p>
                We already grabbed in hand some main problems and expectations from shareholders before, but in order to understand more the context, we thought that talking with our end-real-users was worthy. So we arranged a meeting-call with who directly implementing the work and would also be the users using the software. Here are what we got:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't make everything too new, because it takes time for them to adapt, especially the UI.</li>
                <li>They print information all the time, so make sure it fits with the size of A4 paper.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511174511562-5f7f18b874f8?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1170&q=80" alt="" class="article_img" />
            <p class="img_caption">Meeting with users.</p>
            <h4>3. Sitemap</h4>
            <p>
                We worked closely and regularly with stakeholders from the beginning of this project, just to make sure the possibility of taking wrong direction must be the lowest. And after few days of discussing with them, we came up with the very first version of sitemap. We visualized everything down to those rectangles.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/AIC/Sitemap.png" alt="Sitemap" class="article_img" />
            <img src="../img/AIC/Sitemap_breakdown.png" alt="Sitemap" class="article_img" />
            <p class="img_caption">Building sitemap.</p>
            <p>
                Then we broke it down to tons of branches and also added flow to it. Sticked with seasoned BA team to define those versions of sitemap brought to me lots of experiences, took their advices helping me to make better stream for the whole site. There’s just one simple rule: The golden path should as just short as possible.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Wireframe</h4>
            <p>
                We ran this project in Agile practice so everytime I got the input, I worked on it right after that. At this point, I was taking first features for each page from BA and that means wireframe was ready to be made. I did the mid fidelity wireframe first to give it the layout.
            </p>
            <img src="../img/AIC/Mid_wireframe.png" alt="" class="article_img" />
            <p class="img_caption">Mid fidelity Wireframe.</p>
            <p>One of the hardest part when I built the wireframe was the Dashboard. I came up with some ideas then discussed it with few medical staffs who were going to use it. The result was out of my prediction but what they felt good was what we should follow.</p>
         </div>
          <div class="row table_chart">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 left_column">
              <img src="../img/AIC/High_wireframe 1.png" alt="" class="img_split">
              <p class="img_caption">1st version.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 right_column">
                <img src="../img/AIC/High_wireframe 2.png" alt="" class="img_split">
                <p class="img_caption">2nd version.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h4>5. High fidelity Wireframe</h4>
          <p>
            Next, I moved to build high version of wireframe and it was also the appearance concept that we brought to the stakeholders for the first presentation. As we discussed before, the UI wouldn’t be looked the same as some fancy designs on social media that we used to see, I wanted to keep it clean, familiar with what they saw everyday and strongly focused on UX aspect.
          </p>
          <img src="../img/AIC/High_wireframe 3.png" alt="" class="article_img" />
          <p class="img_caption">I decided to picked up blue as the main color for this project interspersed with red.</p>
          <h4>6. User interface</h4>
          <p>
            Yet the were few things needed to be fixed on both the wireframe and the concept of UI but in general the presentation went well. I got supported from co-workers to adjust the wireframe while kept building the components for UI work. At this point, things became so suffocating because of its deadline. My team and I had to work overtime over the weekend, we even ate and slept at office in order to keep the commitment. I consider this one of the best experience of my career. We fought to help repulsing the epidemic together.

          <div class="row table_chart">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 left_column">
              <img src="../img/AIC/Rest 3.png" alt="" class="img_split">
              <p class="img_caption">We took short sleeps whenever felt tired.</p>

              <p class="img_caption">Time to feed ourself and support nation football team.</p>
            </div>   
          </div>
          <p>
            The final UI was released not long after that and it came with a fully version of prototype. Shareholders were very strict and thorough in product control, they wanted to “feel” the product first before building it, because there was not a second chance to make it.
          </p>
          <p>
            And the amount of work that we did was amazing (and jaw-dropping):
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>3000 screens in total.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The next presentation came in each 1 week, whenever we finished something, we would presented then passed it over the Dev team.
          </p>
          <div class="row table_chart">
            <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 left_column">

            </div>   
          </div>
          <h3>Growth</h3>
          <p>
            Working in an early-stage startup was an amazing path that taught me
            alot. I do always look back to see if I there’s anything needed to
            be changed, and here are some key takeaways from this project:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>You can’t satisfy all users.</li>
            <li>There’s no standard procedure. Be flexible.</li>
            <li>
              Make sure that your stakeholders (and other relevant teams) are
              totally understand your team’s role and work.
            </li>
            <li>Keep testing at any stage you can.</li>
            <li>Don’t try to be perfect at the beginning time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And, finally, here are some of the main screens that I made, take a look at it:
