          Phenikaa is well-known for its high-end quartz stone production for
          many years. And then 2019 was a remarkable milestone for them when
          they decided to enter a completely new section: Smart Light.
        </h5>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="project_content">
      <h3 class="content_title">How it was like</h3>
      <p class="content_content">
        I worked as an UX designer and got a chance to lead a team of 3 members
        including Graphic Designer, Industrial Designer & UI Designer. Our
        mission was to create smart bulb from package to its shape and the
        application to control it.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_1.png" alt="" class="content_img" />
      <p class="content_caption">
        Four of us was working closely together on this project.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content_title">Approach</h3>
      <p class="content_content">
        The overall view is always my top priority when I start a project, not
        only from a designer’s view but other aspects. Talking to stakeholders
        helps me grabbing the ideas of bussiness goals as well as their needs
        and wants. Plus, having a conversation with them regularly is also a
        good way to build relationship, which is very important in the work.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content_title">Expectation & Vision</h3>
      <p class="content_content">
        Shareholders always got their expectations about the project, even there
        is nothing clear in their mind at the beginning stages (which usually
        happens) I”ll always ask them some questions to get their ideas, pain
        points, what they need, etc. Capturing these things is essential. It
        minimizes risk, saves time and team’s effort. And below is what I got
        after discussing with them: Modern-looking, minimalist & bright tone.
        Easy to use. Cross-platform. Goal: Largest smart light supplier for
        business customers (B2B) Target group of user: young and middle-aged
        customers, successful, good financial, living in apartment in developed
        cities. Technology-lovers and willing to pay to improve the convenience
        of life.

      </p>
      <h3 class="content_title">Challenge</h3>
      <p class="content_content">
        The biggest challenge that I faced was the shareholders’ misconception.
        To them, all about design was just the “look” side, and they wanted it
        to be done as quickly as possible. To cope with it, I did show them the
        3W:
      </p>
      <ul class="content_list">
        <li>WHAT exactly we were going to do.</li>
        <li>WHY we needed to perform it, and:</li>
        <li>WHEN should we make it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="content_content">
        Another problem we had was that manpower shortage to start the job as we
        aimed. However, this is a part of work, and our job is to find solution
        for it.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content_title">Action</h3>
      <h4 class="content_sub_title_1st">1. Research product</h4>
      <p class="content_content">
        Lack of knowledge about new domain made us felt a bit confused to get
        started. So I decided to research informations about “Light” and
        transfered it to the whole team, here was the list to begin:
      </p>
      <ul class="content_list">
        <li>Types of bulbs.</li>
        <li>Uses of each.</li>
        <li>Connection methods.</li>
        <li>Smart bulb’s pros and cons.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="content_content">
        Next step, I wanted the team could understand how a smart light works,
        so we purchased some light bulbs, this would benefit:
      </p>
      <ul class="content_list">
        <li>
          The industrial designer would know the bulb’s components and how it
          attached to each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          The graphic designer could have some ideas about the package look by
          its features, functions and tons of others elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The UI designer would sketch about the icon, the mood, the style of
          the product.
        </li>
        <li>
          On my side, I had a picture of how a smart light works. Plus, I would
          know where my competitors were going and if there was anything I could
          improve on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_1.png" alt="" class="content_img" />
      <p class="content_caption">Setting up the light.</p>
      <h4 class="content_sub_title">2. Research user</h4>
      <p class="content_content">
        After I got some informations from real product testing, I wanted to
        discuss it with relevant teams, which were engineers and stakeholders.
        They gave me a list of features that at that time the technology we had
        was able to do and what features they wanted to have. I took them and
        decided to research on real users, who was going to use our product.
      </p>
      <p class="content_content">
        Based on our target group of user that we created before, I broke it
        down to 2 categories:
      </p>
      <ul class="content_list">
        <li>Experienced in using light automation.</li>
        <li>Never used it but interested about it.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="content_content">
        I made these 2 groups of user because I wanted to hear their thoughts
        and opinions stood on their knowledge. Then I’ll try to reconcile it and
        to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution. Here was the result:
      </p>
      <div class="content_compare">
        <h4 class="content_compare">Experienced users</h4>
        <ul class="content_list">
          <li>Optimize connection method/reduce steps.</li>
          <li>Unlimited number of lights.</li>
          <li>Other brand accepted.</li>
          <li>Control it from everywhere on Earth.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="content_compare">Non-Experienced users</h4>
        <ul class="content_list">
          <li>Easy to connect.</li>
          <li>Voice control.</li>
          <li>More color-mixed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4 class="content_sub_title">3. Create user personas</h4>
      <p class="content_content">
        A deep understanding of target audience is required if we aim for a good
        product. So then I made up User Personas to list down everything we knew
        so far about our users.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_1.png" alt="" class="content_img" />
      <p class="content_caption">Creating User Personas.</p>
      <p class="content_content">
        Further more, User Personas also benefits to different roles like
        Graphic Designer and UI Designer, they will have more clues to visualize
        things that fit with end users.
      </p>
      <h4 class="content_sub_title">4. User flow</h4>
      <p class="content_content">
        Next step, I decided to craft User Flow’s first version so stakeholders
        and relevant departments could be able to understand how users interact
        with the app. This step is more cruicial for the developers, they would
        basically know their tasks in future and could make a well preperation.
      </p>
      <p class="content_content">
        Keeping closely relationship with developers is also so important. I was
        always kept talking to them, dicussing my ideas about everything related
        to the design: from the flow to the interaction, UI, animation, etc. I
        just wanted to make sure we were totally getting our points. Imagine
        when you’ve done something and the answer you took from them is: “Sorry,
        we don’t have enough resources to perform it” or “The time is running
        out, we have to find the simpler solutions”. It’s so frustrated!
      </p>
      <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_1.png" alt="" class="content_img" />
      <p class="content_caption">Crafting user flow.</p>
      <h4 class="content_sub_title">5. Wireframe</h4>
      <p class="content_content">
        Next, I was designing the low-fidelity version of Wireframe. This is
        always my most favorite part. Everything we gathered before now could be
        translated to the design to keep testing on users. After finished it, I
        made a test on a project-wide scale, where every members tried it and
        gave feedback. Then I did prototyte for the mid-fidelity Wireframe and
        tested it on real users: Here was something I got:
      </p>
      <ul class="content_list">
        <li>Users wanted to connect their bulb without sign in.t</li>
        <li>They wanted to control the light right at the room screen.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_1.png" alt="" class="content_img" />
      <p class="content_caption">Creating low-fidelity wireframe.</p>
      <p class="content_content">
        At this stage, UI was started to create. The UI guy and I were
        collecting moodboard then trying to create some of the concepts.
        Stakeholders seemed really couln’d wait to see how our app would look
        like, so I gathered the develope teams and we made plans together to
        boost up the UI process.
      </p>
      <p class="content_content">
        I told them everything about our ideas, how it would be look like and in
        return, we also open to hear their advice, I wanted to know if it was
        possible to perform or not. Everything was to make sure that all risks
        must be kept to a minimum and the only way to do it is to maintain
        communication.
      </p>
      <p class="content_content">
        After that, I kept improving Wireframe and made the high-fidelity one.
        This thing could help calm our stakeholders and our users could find it
        easier to spread their thoughts.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_1.png" alt="" class="content_img" />
      <p class="content_caption">Creating high-fidelity wireframe.</p>
      <h4 class="content_sub_title">6. Usability testing</h4>
      <p class="content_content">
        AAt that point, I came up with this idea: why don’t we make a testing
        environment, where users could experience the product in the place looks
        like their home. After this idea was passed, I listed groups of testing
        audiences and started designing the place. It took 2 weeks to complete
        from sketching, designing, procuring materials, constructing and
        finishing.
      </p>
      <p class="content_content">
        I wanted to build a place that resembled an actual house as much as
        possible, this made it more comfortable for users to use and give their
        opinions.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_1.png" alt="" class="content_img" />
      <p class="content_caption">Designing testing environment.</p>
      <p class="content_content">
        To made sure other jobs were still running smoothly, I only gathered
        enough members to do some of the main features that we were going to
        build. Beside, I also created scenarios for users to complete the task
        then we would see where they found unsatisfy.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/HomeSmartLight/IMG_1.png" alt="" class="content_img" />
      <p class="content_caption">Testing on real user.</p>
      <p class="content_content">
        This test gave us invaluable feedbacks from real users. They were tested
        on an interoperable product, which gave the best indication of what they
        are satisfied/dissatisfied with. And for an UX designer, nothing is more
        valuable than this genuine responses, here was what I found:
      </p>
      <ul class="content_list">
        <li>They wanted to be able to control all light at one time.</li>
        <li>They wished there were more scenarios to choose.</li>
        <li>They wanted their light’s setting could be saved and restored.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="content_title">Growth</h3>
      <p class="content_content">
        Working in an early-stage startup was an amazing path that taught me
        alot. I do always look back to see if I there’s anything needed to be
        changed, and here are some key takeaways from this project:
      </p>
      <ul class="content_list">
        <li>You can’t satisfy all users.</li>
        <li>There’s no standard procedure. Be flexible.</li>
        <li>
          Make sure that your stakeholders (and other relevant teams) are
          totally understand your team’s role and work.
        </li>
        <li>Keep testing at any stage you can.</li>
        <li>Don’t try to be perfect at the beginning time.</li>
      </ul>
